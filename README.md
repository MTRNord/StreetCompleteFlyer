# StreetCompleteFlyer

This repository contains an English (and later a german flyer) about the Streetcomplete app for Openstreetmap.
Images used belong to the Streetcomplete Project.
The tool used for editing is called Scribus.

The goal of this is to bring Streetcomplete and therefor Openstreetmap to the people in my local town.
It is aimed at those that do not want to ever look at the wiki or the Web App.
